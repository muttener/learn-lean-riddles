# Advantages of the Bayesian Approach to Monty Hall

1. **Sample Space Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: 3³ = 27 game states (car, pick, host)
   - Bayesian approach: 3 car positions

2. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - Joint approach: Custom probability measures and weighting functions
   - Bayesian approach: Standard Bayes' theorem

3. **Calculation Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: Weighted sums over 27 states with validity constraints
   - Bayesian approach: Simple 3-term Bayes calculation

4. **Conceptual Clarity**:
   - Joint approach: Mixes unknowns and observations in same probability space
   - Bayesian approach: Clear separation of unknowns vs evidence

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Joint approach: 4-door version requires 4³ = 64 states
   - Bayesian approach: 4-door version requires 4 states


The Bayesian approach recognizes that we only need to model the **unknown** (car position).
Everything else (player choice, host action) is **evidence** that updates our beliefs.

This is exactly what the commenter meant by focusing on "the unknown state of the world"
and using "likelihood functions" rather than "weighting functions".
