-- River crossing puzzle: Three jealous mathematicians (A, B, C) and their three secret notebooks (a, b, c) must cross a river.
-- The boat carries at most two items (people or notebooks).
-- No mathematician may be left alone with another’s notebook unless the owner is present.
-- Can they all get across safely?

-- The two river banks

-- The full state of the puzzle: positions of boat, mathematicians, and notebooks
structure State where
  boat : Bank  -- Boat position

-- Safety condition: no notebook is ever with another mathematician unless its owner is present
-- (i.e., notebook i cannot be with mathematician j unless mathematician i is also present, for i ≠ j)

    Ni = Mj → Mi = Mj

-- A move: either one or two items cross the river, with a proof that the move preserves safety
inductive Move where
| one (f : State → State) (h : ∀ s, safe s → safe (f s))
