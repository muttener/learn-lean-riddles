# The Monty Hall Problem

**Problem**: Three doors, one car, two goats. You pick a door, host opens a goat door.
Should you switch? **Answer**: Yes! Switching gives 2/3 probability vs 1/3 for staying.

## Results and Verification

The key insight: When you initially pick wrong (2/3 probability), switching wins.
When you initially pick right (1/3 probability), switching loses.

  ("Car behind door 3", world_with_car d3)
]

-- Let's see the results:
#eval win_by_switch     -- Should be 4 (switching wins in 4/6 scenarios)
#eval win_by_staying    -- Should be 2 (staying wins in 2/6 scenarios)
#eval total_scenarios   -- Should be 6 total scenarios

-- Verify our logic with specific examples:
#eval possible_host_opens (world_with_car d1) d1  -- [d2, d3] - both doors have goats
#eval possible_host_opens (world_with_car d1) d2  -- [d3] - only d3 has goat (d1 has car)

-- Show all scenarios in a readable format:
#eval all_scenarios.map fun s =>
  (s.pick, s.host_open, s.switch_to, s.switch_wins, s.stay_wins)

-- Let's check the actual values:
#eval win_by_switch
#eval win_by_staying
#eval total_scenarios

## Mathematical Analysis

The Monty Hall problem demonstrates that switching is always better.
