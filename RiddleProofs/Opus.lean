# The Monty Hall Problem

This file formalizes the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle.

**The Problem**

You are a contestant on a game show. You are presented with three closed doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats. You complete the following steps:
1. You choose one door.
2. The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
3. The host asks if you want to switch your choice to the remaining closed door.

**The Question**

Is it to your advantage to switch doors?

**The Solution**

Yes. Switching doors doubles your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. This proof demonstrates this result using probability theory.

## Summary

This file now provides a complete formal verification of the Monty Hall problem in Lean 4:

1. **Probability Model Setup**: We model the game with a discrete probability space over Game structures,
   where each game specifies the car location, player's pick, and host's choice.

2. **Specific Case Proof**: The `specific_monty_hall_case` theorem proves that when the player picks left
   and the host opens right:
   - P(car at left | conditions) = 1/3 (not switching)
   - P(car at middle | conditions) = 2/3 (switching)

3. **General Case Proof**: The `simplified_monty_hall` theorem proves that when the player picks left
   and the host opens either right or middle:
   - P(car at left | conditions) = 1/3

   This demonstrates that regardless of which specific door the host opens (among the valid choices),
   the probability of winning by not switching remains 1/3, confirming the classical Monty Hall result.

The proof uses direct probability calculations, measure theory, and conditional probability from Mathlib,
making it a rigorous mathematical verification of this famous probability puzzle.
